This endpoint should receive messages when the following verification endpoints are called: - https://docs.nextreason.com/reference unify-journeys-api-resend-verification - https://docs.nextreason.com/reference/sendotp-1

    With both calls, the auth_type defines the payload of the user_id which can be an email address or email.
    In our EdgeWorker code we will be adding two fields, the user_id_sha and url_path json payload:

    {
      "auth_type": "sms",
      "client_id": "123",
      "redirect_uri": "https://redirect_url",
      "user_id": "0612345678",
      "user_id_sha":"c0b290ded1e79a3e7b7c61e2ab6fe4e4184f854ef755f064d4e8903f7d2ee474",
      "url_path": "/idp/1/otp/send"
    }

    The user_id will be used to lookup the UUID which will also be our _key.
    We will only store the sha256 of the user_id for privacy reasons.
    As we can't create a sha digest in the stream worker, let's do that in the EdgeWorker.

    Our final collection will contain something like this where the _key is UUID of this user which will match to the identity cloud backend.
    {
      "fraudHits": [
        {
          "time": 1720033142171,
          "user_id": "53af329367f2bd21cf89bf1c2e5c78c73e63593a62ce5aa926a5ef770fda4026",
          "url_path": "/test/send/nora"
        },
        {
          "time": 1720033143607,
          "user_id": "53af329367f2bd21cf89bf1c2e5c78c73e63593a62ce5aa926a5ef770fda4026",
          "url_path": "/test/send/nora"
        }
      ],
      "fraudster": false
    }

    An external service can now decide when something is fraud and set the fraudster boolean.
